# A12Y means Accountability

In this project, I, Avi Drucker, ask for help from my community in order to create more accountability in my life. My intent and hope is that, with increased visibility, I can better perform and create value for myself, my community, and our collective future well-being.

## Intentions

I will be labeling and categorizing tasks in this project repository to stay organized and focused. By segmenting tasks (called "issues" on this GitHub platform) into milestones / sprints, I hope to:
- create an environment where I can more easily enter work flow
- "work smarter" to leverage my strengths, and
- reduce the stress of working harder (challenging tasks) and/or simply longer hours

## The Mile-stones

1. For starters, I will create a "getting started" mile-stone for the setup of this project, initial collaborators, intention setting, etc..
2. Secondly, I will create a "portfolio site" milestone. This will group together the work I do to enhance my personal portfolio website to a presentable status.
3. Thirdly, I will create a "self management" milestone that helps guide my health maintenance, sleep, exercise, and unplugging from work mode & digital devices.

More to come ...
